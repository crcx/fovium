Fovium is a small 32-bit stack VM.

It was designed to create a simple and consistent platform for Fronds. But will
perhaps be used for other things as well.

See ops-by-function to see the opcodes.

See spec.txt for a detailed description of the VM.


To build type "make"

To run type eg "./fovium fronds.img"

See fronds.txt for how to use fronds
