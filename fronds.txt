alt-s     starts search mode which ends when you release all the keys. space key does nothing, so you can switch to holding that if you want. Type a forth word then release all the keys. If the word has a defintion the editor will jump to that definition.

alt-space and hold space (or alt) while you type a forth word or a number. When you release the word will be executed (or if it's a number it will be placed on the stack.) Output is limited to ninety something white characters which are placed in the history section below the source display.
