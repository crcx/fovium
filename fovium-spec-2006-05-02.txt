FOVIUM VIRTUAL MACHINE SPECIFICATION

INTRODUCTION

	This document (when completed) will describe the fovium virtual machine in
	sufficient detail that you could write a compatible implementation without
	looking at an existing implementation. This document will be the normative
	reference.


TERMINOLOGY

	client   - The software running inside fovium.
	image    - A single continuous block of memory containing the client.


OVERVIEW

	Fovium is a simple stack-based virtual machine. It has a data stack, flag
	stack and return stack all of which are easily accessible to the client.

	Fovium provides (through a syscall mechanism) access to input events and
	textual (and later graphical) output.

	Fovium images come in two flavors: big-endian and little-endian. Compliant
	Fovium implementations must support both.


IMAGES OVERVIEW

	The client is stored in a single image. This is presumably kept in a file. 
	Fovium allocates 1MiB of memory, puts the image at the beginning of it and
	starts executing it.


INITIALIZATION

	To start up the client Fovium loads the image into the beginning of a 1MiB
	block of memory so that it is accessible to the client at memory address
	0. Fovium then checks the endianness of the image by looking at the first
	instruction word of the image which must contain just a branch
	instruction. Then Fovium starts executing the image at address 0 with all
	registers and stacks initialized to nulls.


INSTRUCTION ENCODING

	Opcodes are 6 bits long. They are packed into 32-bit words starting with
	the low bits. Instruction words are always aligned in memory. Most
	instructions consist entirely of the opcode, the others (lit and branches)
	have a single operand as explained below.

	Note that the last instruction field is only 2 bits wide, so most
	instructions won't fit in that position. As it turns out this adds no
	complexity to fovium, because the 0 opcode (next) loads the next
	instruction word, and so fovium need not keep track of which opcode
	position it is at, and can instead simply shift the instruction word right
	until it reaches a 0 opcode.

	BRANCH ENCODING

	The call and branch instructions get their target address from the
	remaining bits of the instruction word (after their opcode is removed) by
	placing these bits two from the low end. The two lowest bits of the target
	address are always 0 because all instruction words are aligned.

	LITERAL ENCODING

	The lit instruction gets its value from the next 32-bit word that would be
	loaded for the instruction stream. It is important to note that while the
	lit instruction does advance the instruction word reader to the next word
	it does not cause fovium to read in a new instruction word. ie after a lit
	instruction, execution continues as normal in the current instruction word
	with the next opcode after the lit opcode.

	EXAMPLE

	Here's a quick example of a few instructions. They are represented with
	the low bits on the right, one character per bit, and one word per line.

	00000000000000++++++llllllllllll
	00000000000000000000000000000001
	00000000000000000000000000000010
	aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaacccccc
	00000000000000000000000000;;;;;;

	symbol:                      meaning:
	llllll                       opcode for lit
	++++++                       opcode for +
	cccccc                       opcode for call
	aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa   target address for call instruction
	;;;;;;                       opcode for return

	In the language Forth, this would be represented as the following source:

	1 2 + . ;

	So first (low 6 bits of the first instruction word) is the lit
	instruction. This loads the next instruction word (second line) onto the
	stack. Now the second opcode (in the first line) is also lit. This grabs
	the next instruction word (third line) and pushes it onto the stack. The
	third opcode (still first line) is + which is executed, thus adding the 1
	and 2 pushed by the lit instructions. The next opcode (still first line)
	is 0 which tells Fovium to load the next instruction word (fourth line)
	and start executing it.

	First opcode on the fourth line is a call instruction. First the call
	instruction pushes the return stack with the address of the next unused
	instruction word (5th line above). Then it calculates the target address
	by using the remaining bits from the instruction word two bits from the
	low end (that is aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa00). Then it loads the next
	instruction from that address and continues execution as normal from
	there. In this case we expect that at some point the code will return to
	this part of memory and execute the fifth instruction word above (that we
	pushed the address for.) Its first opcode is a return, which pops the
	return stack, and branches to the address it contains, (and reloads the
	instruction word from that address.)


STACKS AND REGISTERS

	Fovium maintains three stacks and three registers.

	STACKS

	1) The data stack can hold 1024 32-bit integers.

	2) The return stack can hold 1024 32-bit integers.

	3) The flag stack holds exactly 32 1-bit flags. The flag stack is
	circular, which means if you pop it 32 times it is in exactly the same
	state.

	The data stack is used for most calculation and such. It is used to hold
	values and memory addresses and such. Most operands are passed on the data
	stack.

	The return stack's main purpose is to hold the return addresses for calls.
	but it is frequently used to store other values, loop counters, etc..

	The flag stack holds true/false flags. Flags are pushed by comparison
	operators and popped by conditional branches and conditional returns.

	REGISTERS

	Fovium must maintain the following registers outside of the client's 1MiB
	memory space:

	1) IP (instruction pointer.) This keeps track of where the next instruction
	word will come from. It is incremented (to the next word) by the 'lit' and
	'next' instructions. It is changed considerably by 'call', 'branch' and
	'return' instructions.

	2) IW (instruction word.) This stores the current instruction word while
	it is being executed. This must be stored outside the client's memory
	space so that it is not disturbed even if the memory where this word came
	from is changed while it is executing.

	3) A (address register.) This register is used directly by the client with
	instructions such as '+@', 'b+!' and '>a'.

SYSCALLS

	To execute a syscall, put the syscall number on the stack and execute the
	syscall instruction.

	SUMMARY

	#   name     stack effect    description
	0   exit     ( x -- )        terminate the client (with return code x)
	1   save     ( addr u -- )   save u bytes to mass storage
	16  emit     ( c -- )        output ASCII char c
	17  wait_event  ( us -- FL:true a b | FL:false )  get input
	18  term_color  ( x -- )     change the color of future text output
	19  term_move   ( x -- )     move the text output cursor to position x
	

	EXIT SYSCALL
		syscall number: 0
		stack effect: ( x -- )
		description:

			Stop executing the client. x is meant to be a return code if that
			makes any sense for the environment in which fovium is running.

	SAVE SYSCALL
		syscall number: 1
		stack effect: ( addr u -- )
		description:

			save u bytes (at addr) to mass storage. Save them such that they
			could be executed as an image in fovium. Do not overwrite anything
			in order to save.
	
	EMIT SYSCALL
		syscall number: 16
		stack effect: ( c -- )
		description:

			Output the printable ASCII character c. If c is not a printable
			ascii character (32-126) print a single space. If c is 10 clear the
			rest of the current line and advance the cursor to the beginning of
			the next line.
	
	WAIT_EVENT SYSCALL
		syscall number: 17
		stack effect: ( us -- FL:true a b type ) or ( us -- FL:false )
		description:
			
			Wait up to us microseconds for an input event. Wait only as long as
			necessary (ie if there is an input event available already do not
			wait at all.) If there is still no event to report by the time us
			microseconds have passed then return false (on the flag stack.)

			If an input event is available (or becomes available within the us
			microseconds) push true onto the flag stack, and return the event
			as three items on the stack. The first is the type and the others
			have different meanings depending on the type.

			BUTTON EVENT
				type number: 0
				b: up/down (0 means this button is now up, 1 means down)
				a: button number (see keysyms.h FIXME)

			MOUSE EVENT
				type number: 1
				b: new x coordinate for pointing device
				a: new y coordinate for pointing device
				(Note: this event type is not yet implemented in the reference
				implementation)

	TERM_COLOR SYSCALL
		syscall number: 18
		stack effect: ( x -- )
		description:

			Change the foreground and background color that will be used for
			further text output (using the 'emit' syscall.) The available
			colors are (0-7):

			black, red, greed, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white

			The low 3 bits of x is the new foreground color. The next higher
			bit is ignored, then the next three bits determine the background
			color.
			
	TERM_MOVE SYSCALL
		syscall number: 19
		stack effect: ( x -- )
		description:
			
			Move the output cursor (which need not be visible) to position x.
			The terminal is 100 characters wide by 35 characters tall. position
			0 is the top, left corner. positions count up as they go right and
			wrap around when they reach the end of the line. So, for example
			the first character on the 2nd line would be at position 100.
